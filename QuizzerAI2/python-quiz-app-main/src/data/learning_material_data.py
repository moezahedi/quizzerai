        "content": "Deepfakes are highly realistic fake videos, images, or audio created using artificial intelligence (AI). They often replicate a person‚Äôs appearance, voice, or actions, making it appear as though someone said or did something they never actually did. This technology uses advanced machine learning to combine and manipulate source materials, producing convincing results.",

        "content": "Deepfakes are powered by a type of AI called deep learning, which processes large amounts of data to imitate a person‚Äôs face, voice, or actions. For instance, algorithms known as generative adversarial networks (GANs) continuously compare real and fake images until the fake versions become highly realistic. Over time, these systems 'learn' to replicate patterns of movement, speech, and appearance with increasing accuracy.",

However, specialized tools can help by analyzing video frames and audio patterns.",

For instance, a fake video of a public figure could harm their reputation or sway public opinion. Deepfakes can also be used for fraud, blackmail, or fabricating evidence in legal cases.
